      <h1>Rollback</h1>
<p>
The student, whose name Gem did not know, blinked in surprise. "Why not?"
</p>
<p>
"I can't have you go research this. It isn't our department. Computer science, maybe."
</p>
<p>
"I thought for sure this would interest you. This course isn't about Technology and Society today. It's about tomorrow."
</p>
<p>
Gem turned her monitor around so that the student, inching closer to the desk, would sit back. "Do you see this? It's the number of citable works using Datalirium. It was a flash in the pan. Not a peep in the past six months. Not going anywhere tomorrow."
</p>
<p>
"No, that's not what I'm interested in at all." A pause. "I mean, it started there."
</p>
<p>
"It started where?"
</p>
<p>
"No one knows for sure, but it started with citable works. Then there's this guy, hackercept, who says it's a new currency."
</p>
<p>
"I don't see how that could be."
</p>
<p>
"The concept was to track your work and verify against this network. So research had to be accurate. It couldn't get forged or backdated, anyway. So hackercept adds this extra component, a 3D fractal. If someone finds patterns in the fractal, they get one Datalyra. And computers can't mine it; the geometry is too complicated."
</p>
<p>
Gem typed a few words into Google and scrolled a bit. "Could you write me an abstract? By tomorrow, even? I don't want the project to get ahead of you, if you need to change topics."
</p>
<p>
"Thank you ma'am."
</p>
<p>
As the student stood to leave he admitted, "I'm impressed you knew about Datalirium anyway. Where did you hear about it?"
</p>
<p>
Gem smiled. "Just a friend of a friend. Undergrad."
<br/>
On the inside, she was panicking.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
In Gem's sophomore year, the college campus had been completely different. There were still areas
she had not yet explored, labs for higher-level students and their higher-level projects. The room which would
one be Gem's office was not yet constructed.
</p>
<p>
It was a dewy January morning, Gem remembered, when she had heard about Datalirium. She remembered because her sneakers
squeaked all the way down the main hall of the computer science building, because she'd walked straight across
the quad, because she liked to see the grass after a cold winter break in Minnesota. Before the semester began,
they had two weeks to join a class or not, to study a subject short-term or not. The flyer for this session had
been only: "Hack. Bring laptops." The grad student organizer made sure the undergrads were in random groups and then,
frustratingly, disappeared to her lab.
</p>
<p>
In the meetings that they held afterward, there was an unspoken rule that no one had come up with the idea. But
in Gem's mind, it was Edward. He showed them them the article: "Prize-winning Lab Retracts Paper". He asked the
question, "can we make a lab notebook that can't tell a lie?". It was not the group's favorite idea. But it
was a good question. It stuck with them. When Nathan's idea failed to wow in its first demo, they met in the
library's whiteboard-walled study room, and Edward asked it again.
</p>
<p>
"No," said Nathan. He and Paul, the last of the group, began listing reasons. A determined liar would give the lab
computer false numbers. They could alter the recorded data, and electronic sensors, and test equipment, to fit what
they wanted. 
</p>
<p>
"What if they couldn't alter any of that?" Gem had asked. "The moment data is recorded, by sensor or by human, it
gets sent out on a network. That's how Bitcoin transactions work, you know. Everyone has a copy of everyone's
checkbook. We do that to the lab notebook. You can't tell everyone to rewrite your data if you change your
mind later."
</p>
<p>
"They could still give the notebook false numbers," reminded Paul.
</p>
<p>
"Only if they knew from the beginning, each measurement, what they wanted the numbers to say. Fraud is usually an act
of last-minute desperation."
</p>
<p>
"Gem, it either works against a determined liar or it doesn't work at all."
</p>
<p>
Edward cut in, "what if they don't know what they want the numbers to say?"
</p>
<p>
Paul and Gem processed this.
</p>
<p>
"Double blind experiments. Any instrument throws a second factor, an offset into the output. If the two-factor number
is off, it's fake. The liar won't know how to alter his numbers. The only way to get data and know what it
means is to share it with the network and convince it that a human did the experiment without knowing the result."
</p>
<p>
Nathan picked up a whiteboard marker. "We can look at it."
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
By the end of the two-week class, they had only made an opaque cylinder that Tweeted its volume. The protocol itself
was never part of the class. In their follow-up meetings the four resolved to become a club. They never registered
with the Activities Board, because they would need to accept freshman members and limit their library time.  As far
as the librarian knew, they were a study group.
</p>
<p>
But one night, deep inside one of the computer labs, they gathered around Paul's touchscreen tablet. It awoke with
a chirp and the name DATALIRIUM appeared. Edward tapped at his phone to start the genesis block. "2014/03
Prize-winning Lab Retracts P" the first message read. They groaned at the bug.
</p>
<p>
"Keep it running," Paul insisted. "We'll put some data on it and see if it sticks."
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
Keeping the project a secret from friends, classmates, and parents was easy. No one in their network would understand
the project, as far as they knew.  There were a few times Edward would hint at a startup. The problem was that their
protocol was too easy to reproduce, the hardware much easier for any established company to manufacture. Their mini
start-up was bound to be overshadowed or acquired.
</p>
<p>
Edward and Nathan got offers from biochemistry labs in opposite parts of the country. One day Gem ran into them at
the university center, lounging in front of the TV. She came up from behind them and saw slides flickering across
their screens.
</p>
<p>
"You better not be selling out," Gem said.
</p>
<p>
They were startled but moved a futon over for her to sit. Edward was watching some sort of livestream and let
Nathan do the talking. "There's a bigshot professor in Ukraine who's coming here to present at a conference. We're
working with him."
</p>
<p>
"On the project?"
</p>
<p>
"On what happens when he claims asylum. He crossed the wrong guys back home. Big mess. Edward is organizing the
event, so the university asked him to help keep it quiet."
</p>
<p>
"That's... wow I didn't know. It sounds like a big deal."
</p>
<p>
"Yes. All our communication's PGP-encrypted. Huge deal."
</p>
<p>
"Well, is he a computer scientist? Worth telling him about the project?"
</p>
<p>
"We're going to keep him on the dark. In fact, we're going to tell him not to give the talk."
</p>
<p>
"That's too bad."
</p>
<p>
"It's an opportunity, Gem. They're going to call out this professor's name, and anyone can walk up there and talk
about their project.  Any photo will tell them it wasn't the same guy.  But if he has a good topic, people
will listen."
</p>
<p>
Gem wrung her hands to try and lose some nerves. "They will see you! Edward, Nathan, don't fuck this up!"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, we thought of that! We're hiring an actor to read word-for-word off of the slides."
</p>
<p>
"Word-for-word?"
</p>
<p>
"I'm not about to call him up and give him a crash course on cryptography and proof of work. In fact, it's better
if we don't talk to him at all."
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
Gem fidgeted in the auditorium. She could barely see the stage. The others must be in the audience somewhere, but
she hadn't spoken to them since the previous day.
</p>
<p>
The provost was on the microphone. "Aleksander, welcome. Show us what you've been working on."
</p>
<p>
A tall blond man emerged from behind the side curtain. He strode out, shook hands, and grasped the podium tightly.
</p>
<p>
"I am here today to talk about this fantastic project my students have been doing," the false Aleksander said.
"I am talking about Datalibbum."
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
The false Aleksander was mobbed by people at the end of the talk. Students and greybeards alike.
His insisting, "please, no questions!" was the last thing Gem heard as he left the hall.
</p>
<p>
Gem thought for a moment to thank him, to shaking his hand. But it would be too conspicuous. And she had to add
new resources on her server. Datalirium was trending.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
Nathan turned a thimble-sized model of a pH sensor over and over in his hands. He didn't look directly at Gem,
but she remembered that was typical of Nathan, when he was lost in thought.
</p>
<p>
"You can't discount Datalirium, and what's come of it. A sensor like this could be in every lab in the
country. Quite affordable." He returned the sensor to a set of new creations along the edge of his glass
and aluminum desk. "Even without the hype, we've always been profitable."
</p>
<p>
"I don't have anything against what you've made of Datalirium. We always thought... I mean when we were
in school, we thought someone would make money on it." Gem had brought some papers in her bag, but wanted
to get to the point directly and personally. "There's someone out there who's using it as money, as a currency."
</p>
<p>
"What now?" Nathan stopped moving altogether for a second, then shook his head. "I don't see how that'd be.
It's just numbers. There's no computational work like with Bitcoin."
</p>
<p>
"The algorithm measures human work and measurement. So our new friend - his name is Jacob Lenton - puts out
a time-sensitive automata, one of those pattern generators from Wolfram's books. Even an advanced computer
is going to have a hard time looking at the pattern and figuring out if it can folds on itself. A person does
pretty well, 90% of matches it says."
</p>
<p>
"So the person is just looking at patterns all day?"
</p>
<p>
"Well suppose I solve a thousand patterns today. That means me or some other poor soul entered a thousand
different combinations. Or maybe two people solved five hundred each."
</p>
<p>
"I don't see how it matters at all how many you solved. Looking at these sort of patterns is
meaningless."
</p>
<p>
"The currency isn't about the patterns at all. It's measuring human capital. If I solved a million patterns and
didn't miss one, it means I have a thousand workers at their desks with quality control backing them up.
That sort of thing is incredibly valuable in the outsourcing business. You could even sell futures on a thing
like that."
</p>
<p>
That idea took a long time to digest. Nathan wasn't going to change his mind anytime soon, Gem could tell. They
needed more time to research this idea. She needed to find out how long Jacob had been involved in Datalirium.
Somewhere he had talked about opening an office in Bangalore.
</p>
<p>
"You're going to find a story in this, aren't you?" unexpectedly light, especially from Nathan.
</p>
<p>
"I'm sorry?"
</p>
<p>
"You're going to use this to tell me that Datalirium should never have been created. I've had many people
storm in here and tell me the same. Researchers who've been undermined by their own instruments. I make sure
they know that Liri Labs had nothing to do with its creation."
</p>
<p>
"I'm just thinking that without a public inventor, there's no one responsible for it. There's no one to
guide it, no one to throw a wrench in the gears if it goes astray."
</p>
<p>
"An inventor would only mean control, which any open system has to reject. How do we know that this Jacob
guy isn't on the right track?"
</p>
<p>
"Because we know, Nathan. We know."
