      <h1>The Younger Sally Jacobs</h1>
<p>
Publishing this report will be a challenge. Verifying it may be impossible. I can only
assure you that, unlike many other accounts that cross your desk, it has been meticulously
researched. Like my mentor, the Doctor Daniel Chabon, I base my paranormal studies
solely on scientific research and historical documents. Personal accounts are considered
and fact-checked. Hunches are discarded if they cannot be proven. These stories take time
to take form, and when the stories lack merit, you have seen me publish evidence against
the paranormal. It is only by publishing the good and the bad that we can prove that the
paranormal exists.
</p>
<p>
In most of my studies, I am searching for a shred of proof which can tie one story to
another. For this case, I found a preponderance of evidence which was supported by all
persons involved. I found myself searching for one piece out of place, and found none.
If anyone on the peer review committee can comment on the quantum physics explanation
provided by the subject, please contact me.
</p>
<p>
This is the account of the Younger Sally Jacobs.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
I took on Sally’s case for two reasons: a sweet pumpkin pie and a note attached, reading:
</p>
<blockquote>
My husband is a paranormal researcher
<br/>
He never solved his greatest case
<br/>
He too was a student of Dr. Daniel Chabon
</blockquote>
<p>
The leaves were starting to turn and the cold wind beat them against the windows of my
office. I run a practice in a shared office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts, not far
from where Dr. Chabon's school was founded. The other tenants - a real estate broker, a
rail logistics specialist - seem to take little interest in my work. While I am out,
though, they ask the receptionist questions.
</p>
<p>
"They wanted to know," she whispered, "if you were a Scientologist, or whether you could
do magic." She was much too polite to reveal whether it had been mean-spirited or curious
questioning.
</p>
<p>
It was unusual to get a pie, but much more unusual to have another researcher's case
referred. There were only a couple of hours before the first client arrived, continuing
a painfully fruitless research into nanofibers. In those two hours, a phone number turned
into a name, and a name into a handful of links. Sally Jacobs, a painter living in Boston,
who had graduated from art school late, only a few years before. Without knowing Sally's
husband's name, it would be hard to know if he were credible. If he had completed Dr.
Chabon's training, then that was another story.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
The first meeting was at an unfamiliar coffee shop in Boston, just across the river from
MIT. Sally was already there, contemplating what scone to buy at the bakery display,
wearing a bright red sweater - as promised - to identify her. I touched her on the shoulder
and she immediately turned on a smile.
</p>
<p>
"At last, I meet another paranormal fan. At last."
</p>
<p>
We exchanged a few friendly gestures. I asked about the red sweater, and Sally told me
that she wore it to keep bright and happy in the summer. "It seems like the minute frost
snaps, everyone gets their dreary stuff out. Not me."
</p>
<p>
Sally was from Louisiana. "That's where I met my husband," she explains, "and we had this
strange thing happen, which I'm sure you'll be dying to hear about."
</p>
<p>
"You said that your husband never solved it," I recalled, "was it because he thought it was
something small?" I opened up a neat notepad and started the beginnings of an outline.
</p>
<p>
She laughed and caught herself. "Oh no, it was very serious there for a while. I wasn't
sure what I was going to do."
</p>
<p>
Sally was no stranger to the paranormal. Her first job out of college was an intern for
the Baton Rouge Historical Society, where the most popular question callers had was for
haunted tours. "My boss said we weren't supposed to dignify them with an answer," she said,
"but I gave people a few names and asked them to tell me which they had liked. I just
wanted to help people out, with them visting my city, you know?" And eventually she heard
the best reviews from The Old Byer Mansion - "the <em>haunted</em> one", she insisted - and started
working there after college.
</p>
<p>
I had stopped looking at her and down to my notes, slowly spiraling down to
another spooky old house story. This was far below his usual research. This was nothing.
He looked back up again as if with interest, to see Sally looking off into the distance.
</p>
<p>
"... I don't think he'll mind," she said, "my husband, he won't mind if I tell you how
we met. The managers of the Old Byer Mansion brought him in with a couple of others,
hoping he could spark some new interest in the place. Doctor Chabon's way of doing things
was very neat, very new. All of us were following it, and were excited to meet the people
behind it. I remember asking, 'what if they don't find anything?' but we decided to play
it up."
</p>
<p>
"Well, what did they tell you?" I asked. I told her how unusual it was for a serious
researcher to get involved with a haunted house.
"To be honest, Earl - that's my husband - told me later that the team was flat broke."
She laughed and looked away again. "Yeah we should have figured it out. Not something
that comes up when you're giving them the grand tour. Then they had
to come back to us and explain the real problem, which Earl explained was infrasound or
something. He told the manager, my boss, that they could fix it with Silly Putty! The
next minute, the manager was on his feet and pushing him out the door. I figured, well,
nice knowing you." She pauses. "And he was nice. Definitely nice to know him."
</p>
<p>
Days went by without a trace of the team. Sally kept up her job as a tour guide, but things
felt a little more manufactured. The speakers playing eerie piano music set the tone.
Squeaky floorboards, never fixed, made the visitors jump. At home, she had moved in with
someone named Victor, who Sally did not dwell on in our conversation. "If one thing is certain",
she said, "it's that he wants nothing to do with any of this." So I didn't ask about that
in our first meeting.
</p>
<p>
When Earl came back to Baton Rouge, he seemed changed. "More urgent." She thinks a bit,
definitely feeling an answer but not sure what words to use to verbalize it. "More direct."
"Had he fallen for you by then, you think?" I ask. Sally shook her head. "Almost certain
it was because he wanted something different from the mansion contract, or maybe to pick
up other clients, or maybe there was something to the mansion after all? I never fully
dismissed it. But a few days later, it happened."
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
Police reports back much of Sally's story from that point onward. I have seen them on
microfiche in the official records office of Port Allen, Louisiana. I have interviewed
witnesses who were on the scene, officers of the court where hearings took place.
Every event that they remembered matched up with Sally's story. The one thing which Sally
could not explain, and the one thing that every interviewee eagerly speculated on, is how.
</p>
<p>
"I woke up in a nightmare," Sally said. "I would take steps and they would fall on soft
leaves and rough sticks. I knew I was still asleep because I was in the forest, in the
dark, and I didn't remember getting there. When I didn't wake up, I stopped walking. It
was so quiet in the woods that I couldn't think." She yelled wordlessly. There was no
answer. "It seems like the <em>first</em> thing that someone would notice," she admitted, "but
for the first few minutes, I didn't notice that I was naked. And when I <em>did</em> notice, I
still didn't panic or think of going home, because I was still in my dream, and that was
normal." In the distance, she thought that she could hear cars rushing on a highway. As
she walked toward it, pushing aside branches and thorns as best as she could, she thought
that she could hear each vehicle - the sports cars zipping, the tractor-trailers barreling
through, a few people driving home dronelike. "Stupid, right? But that's how I knew it
was more real than a dream." She looked down at her fingertips on the table, and points out
a white scar on her finger. "This was from some crap in the woods." And then, "It doesn't
matter how it got there. All I want to know is, how did I get there?"
</p>
<p>
A passing motorist made a call to 911, and the Port Allen Police Department took Sally into
protective custody. Documents from all witnesses claim that she was fully conscious and aware
at that point, demanding to talk to her family. The officers gave her a blanket and then a
set of warm clothes to cover herself, then insisted on bringing her to the station, in case
she remembered what had happened. An officer - unnamed in the report - called her house to
see if Victor was home. Then another officer drove to the house to collect statements.
</p>
<blockquote>
	It became clear... that ‘Sally’ was lying about her identity. An officer took
	statements from both Victor and Sally Jacobs. Neither had left their house or seen
	anything unusual.
</blockquote>
<p>
Sally was booked into psychiatric care, and labeled as Jane Doe.
</p>
<p>
Sally closed her eyes and touched her forehead. "And I never met her, not once."
<br/>
"Who do you mean?"
<br/>
"The other Sally. The one who was home when I was in the woods."
<br/>
"Do you think she looks like you?"
<br/>
"Identical, unequivocally identical. I can't say it myself, but everyone in there said she
looked the same as me. Though after the first couple of days, they were saying I was the
one who looked the same as her."
