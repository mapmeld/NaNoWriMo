      <h1>The Younger Sally Jacobs</h1>
<p>
Publishing this report will be a challenge. Verifying it may be impossible. I can only
assure you that, unlike many other accounts that cross your desk, it has been meticulously
researched. Like my mentor, the Doctor Daniel Chabon, I base my paranormal studies
solely on scientific research and historical documents. Personal accounts are considered
and fact-checked. Hunches are discarded if they cannot be proven. These stories take time
to take form, and when the stories lack merit, you have seen me publish evidence against
the paranormal. It is only by publishing the good and the bad that we can prove that the
paranormal exists.
</p>
<p>
In most of my studies, I am searching for a shred of proof which can tie one story to
another. For this case, I found a preponderance of evidence which was supported by all
persons involved. I found myself searching for one piece out of place, and found none.
If anyone on the peer review committee can comment on the quantum physics explanation
provided by the subject, please contact me.
</p>
<p>
This is the account of the Younger Sally Jacobs.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
I took on Sally’s case for two reasons: a sweet pumpkin pie and a note attached, reading:
</p>
<blockquote>
My husband is a paranormal researcher
<br/>
He never solved his greatest case
<br/>
He too was a student of Dr. Daniel Chabon
</blockquote>
<p>
The leaves were starting to turn and the cold wind beat them against the windows of my
office. I run a practice in a shared office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts, not far
from where Dr. Chabon's school was founded. The other tenants - a real estate broker, a
rail logistics specialist - seem to take little interest in my work. While I am out,
though, they ask the receptionist questions.
</p>
<p>
"They wanted to know," she whispered, "if you were a Scientologist, or whether you could
do magic." She was much too polite to reveal whether it had been mean-spirited or curious
questioning.
</p>
<p>
It was unusual to get a pie, but much more unusual to have another researcher's case
referred. There were only a couple of hours before the first client arrived, continuing
a painfully fruitless research into nanofibers. In those two hours, a phone number turned
into a name, and a name into a handful of links. Sally Jacobs, a painter living in Boston,
who had graduated from art school late, only a few years before. Without knowing Sally's
husband's name, it would be hard to know if he were credible. If he had completed Dr.
Chabon's training, then that was another story.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
The first meeting was at an unfamiliar coffee shop in Boston, just across the river from
MIT. Sally was already there, contemplating what scone to buy at the bakery display,
wearing a bright red sweater - as promised - to identify her. I touched her on the shoulder
and she immediately turned on a smile.
</p>
<p>
"At last, I meet another paranormal fan. At last."
</p>
<p>
We exchanged a few friendly gestures. I asked about the red sweater, and Sally told me
that she wore it to keep bright and happy in the summer. "It seems like the minute frost
snaps, everyone gets their dreary stuff out. Not me."
</p>
<p>
Sally was from Louisiana. "That's where I met my husband," she explains, "and we had this
strange thing happen, which I'm sure you'll be dying to hear about."
</p>
<p>
"You said that your husband never solved it," I recalled, "was it because he thought it was
something small?" I opened up a neat notepad and started the beginnings of an outline.
</p>
<p>
She laughed and caught herself. "Oh no, it was very serious there for a while. I wasn't
sure what I was going to do."
</p>
<p>
Sally was no stranger to the paranormal. Her first job out of college was an intern for
the Baton Rouge Historical Society, where the most popular question callers had was for
haunted tours. "My boss said we weren't supposed to dignify them with an answer," she said,
"but I gave people a few names and asked them to tell me which they had liked. I just
wanted to help people out, with them visting my city, you know?" And eventually she heard
the best reviews from The Old Byer Mansion - "the <em>haunted</em> one", she insisted - and started
working there after college.
</p>
<p>
I had stopped looking at her and down to my notes, slowly spiraling down to
another spooky old house story. This was far below his usual research. This was nothing.
He looked back up again as if with interest, to see Sally looking off into the distance.
</p>
<p>
"... I don't think he'll mind," she said, "my husband, he won't mind if I tell you how
we met. The managers of the Old Byer Mansion brought him in with a couple of others,
hoping he could spark some new interest in the place. Doctor Chabon's way of doing things
was very neat, very new. All of us were following it, and were excited to meet the people
behind it. I remember asking, 'what if they don't find anything?' but we decided to play
it up."
</p>
<p>
"Well, what did they tell you?" I asked. I told her how unusual it was for a serious
researcher to get involved with a haunted house.
"To be honest, Earl - that's my husband - told me later that the team was flat broke."
She laughed and looked away again. "Yeah we should have figured it out. Not something
that comes up when you're giving them the grand tour. Then they had
to come back to us and explain the real problem, which Earl explained was infrasound or
something. He told the manager, my boss, that they could fix it with Silly Putty! The
next minute, the manager was on his feet and pushing him out the door. I figured, well,
nice knowing you." She pauses. "And he was nice. Definitely nice to know him."
</p>
<p>
Days went by without a trace of the team. Sally kept up her job as a tour guide, but things
felt a little more manufactured. The speakers playing eerie piano music set the tone.
Squeaky floorboards, never fixed, made the visitors jump. At home, she had moved in with
someone named Victor, who Sally did not dwell on in our conversation. "If one thing is certain",
she said, "it's that he wants nothing to do with any of this." So I didn't ask about that
in our first meeting.
</p>
<p>
When Earl came back to Baton Rouge, he seemed changed. "More urgent." She thinks a bit,
definitely feeling an answer but not sure what words to use to verbalize it. "More direct."
"Had he fallen for you by then, you think?" I ask. Sally shook her head. "Almost certain
it was because he wanted something different from the mansion contract, or maybe to pick
up other clients, or maybe there was something to the mansion after all? I never fully
dismissed it. But a few days later, it happened."
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
Police reports back much of Sally's story from that point onward. I have seen them on
microfiche in the official records office of Port Allen, Louisiana. I have interviewed
witnesses who were on the scene, officers of the court where hearings took place.
Every event that they remembered matched up with Sally's story. The one thing which Sally
could not explain, and the one thing that every interviewee eagerly speculated on, is how.
</p>
<p>
"I woke up in a nightmare," Sally said. "I would take steps and they would fall on soft
leaves and rough sticks. I knew I was still asleep because I was in the forest, in the
dark, and I didn't remember getting there. When I didn't wake up, I stopped walking. It
was so quiet in the woods that I couldn't think." She yelled wordlessly. There was no
answer. "It seems like the <em>first</em> thing that someone would notice," she admitted, "but
for the first few minutes, I didn't notice that I was naked. And when I <em>did</em> notice, I
still didn't panic or think of going home, because I was still in my dream, and that was
normal." In the distance, she thought that she could hear cars rushing on a highway. As
she walked toward it, pushing aside branches and thorns as best as she could, she thought
that she could hear each vehicle - the sports cars zipping, the tractor-trailers barreling
through, a few people driving home dronelike. "Stupid, right? But that's how I knew it
was more real than a dream." She looked down at her fingertips on the table, and points out
a white scar on her finger. "This was from some crap in the woods." And then, "It doesn't
matter how it got there. All I want to know is, how did I get there?"
</p>
<p>
A passing motorist made a call to 911, and the Port Allen Police Department took Sally into
protective custody. Documents from all witnesses claim that she was fully conscious and aware
at that point, demanding to talk to her family. The officers gave her a blanket and then a
set of warm clothes to cover herself, then insisted on bringing her to the station, in case
she remembered what had happened. An officer - unnamed in the report - called her house to
see if Victor was home. Then another officer drove to the house to collect statements.
</p>
<blockquote>
	It became clear... that ‘Sally’ was lying about her identity. An officer took
	statements from both Victor and Sally Jacobs. Neither had left their house or seen
	anything unusual.
</blockquote>
<p>
Sally was booked into psychiatric care, and labeled as Jane Doe.
</p>
<p>
Sally closed her eyes and touched her forehead. "And I never met her, not once."
<br/>
"Who do you mean?"
<br/>
"The other Sally. The one who was home when I was in the woods."
<br/>
"Do you think she looks like you?"
<br/>
"Identical, unequivocally identical. I can't say it myself, but everyone in there said she
looked the same as me. Though after the first couple of days, they were saying I was the
one who looked the same as her."
</p>
<p>
"The next morning, the full situation dawned on me," Sally continued. "The police were
sympathetic toward me because they had brought me in, in such a state, but they knew that
it didn't make sense. Either I was raving mad, or setting up a fraud or identity theft."
</p>
<p>
"What evidence did you put together on your side? Your path into the forest, any
missing persons reports, anyone who was with you at the time...?"
</p>
<p>
"I would have been asleep, I'm sure. Complete opposite end of town, my car was in for
repairs, and I didn't have a thing on me. So it was all about the other Sally. Me versus
myself, my friends... I wanted to prove she was a liar, to hate her, to stop her from
doing this to me. By the end of the first day, as me, they were calling her the Real
Sally. Suddenly everything I knew was over and done with. And I couldn't start my life
over until I was out of the psych ward, and they wouldn't give me that until I gave them
another name.
</p>
<p>
On the third day, just a week before Thanksgiving, I told the officer on duty that I was
done. I just needed to call home. And I called my mother, my own mother, and the other
Sally had gotten to her already. I don't remember what she said. We both cried."
</p>
<p>
On the surface I was following along, nodding. The story had gotten intense enough that
I stopped note-taking. But internally I was making the list. There would be photo records
of Sally at the police station and psych ward. Even years later, voting records would make
it possible to track down Victor and Sally... whoever she was. There would need to be
proof that the other Sally existed. DNA would scientifically prove whether she was related
to the rest of the Jacobs family, but that would require their consent. Not likely.
</p>
<p>
Sally halted her story. "I have to go now, but I can follow up. It gets deeper, more involved.
Earl told me... that it's called duplication. It's been heard of before. It has, hasn't it?"
</p>
<p>
"I want to take each case from scratch. You can't depend on every source. You can't show
that a similar-sounding case is related, until you can explain how they both happened."
This was a good way to handle difficult questions.
</p>
<p>
"You're a lot like him." And Sally gathered her things, her scarf and coat.
"The difference is, you might solve this one."
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
Before our second meeting, I had to get a better understanding of what was happening. I had
gotten faxes of police records. In a team with multiple people, one investigator typically
is assigned as the Con Eye, or Conventional Investigator. In my one-man shop, I spent a day
doing nothing but finding weaknesses in the story. I knew that the other Sally had gotten
married to Victor six months later, so the conventional explanation was most likely to be
jealousy. But the Sally who I knew hadn't made any efforts to contact him.
</p>
<p>
I called their house in Baton Rouge, and it went to voicemail. A voice - one I couldn't tell
apart from Sally's - invited to leave a message. I hung up - there would need to be better
tactics if I were to get anything out of Sally.
</p>
<p>
There had been two paranormal investigations into duplication before, described dryly in
my reference book, Strange Happenings. I had been right to tell Sally that they wouldn't
be so helpful. Without an explanation for the earlier cases, it would be hard to link
this case to them. Besides, it looked like Sally's case would have more documentation, if
the police and both duplicates were willing to share their information. 
</p>
<p>
So, I went into the second meeting expecting elaboration. I certainly did not expect to be
sent on one of the strangest turns of my career.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
Sally seemed surprised by what I had found so far. "I didn't tell you how I got out."
</p>
<p>
"Someone came for you." I knew that much. "I would need to go down to the county records
office to get more than that - records, video..."
</p>
<p>
"One day, they said Earl had come to see me, that we knew each other through the paranormal
research community, and that he could help find my family. I knew who my family was, but
more than anything I needed to get out of that place. I would have taken up anyone."
</p>
<p>
"I would have checked it out, too. Duplication isn't something you... I mean it has been
reported, but it isn't something that gets reported every day."
</p>
<p>
"If I thought about it like that, that I was just a curiosity-" she made a quick look of
disgust "- then I would never have accepted. I was just so happy for the moment when
the leave papers were signed, that the automatic doors slid open and I was enveloped in
fresh, cold air. I don't suppose that you know this, but freedom has a taste." The moment
they got to Earl's car, there was a snap of shock. "I held back, Earl noticed, and he says,
'There is something that you need to see. We're in this together.' And it was preposterous,
but there was another of him in the car. And I knew whatever force this was - wherever it
came from - he would have a better chance at an answer than anyone."
</p>
<p>
This changed everything. Unless she had an explanation for what happened to Earl, there
would be some proof. It would be one thing for there to be one look-alike. If both Earl
and Sally were duplicated, then there must be proof.
</p>
<p>
After being picked up by the two, Sally stayed with them at a motel where they tried to
put together the basic facts of what had happened. The other Earl had woken up in the
lobby of a locked train station, also naked. "He pried his way out, and found a cloak room
with some unclaimed coats. He got back to the hotel, knocked on the door, and met himself
right then."
</p>
<p>
"He must have been terrified."
</p>
<p>
"Of course. But they started working on an explanation, and with me involved we had a sort
of partnership. We had to solve this case. I grew closer to the Earl who had fallen into
the train station, who was lost, like me. He started to call himself the Younger Earl,
and me the Younger Sally. It was so much more comforting to stop talking about real versus
copy, or me versus the other. The Older Sally may have had a driver’s
license, a diploma, a job, and a house, but I knew that one day I could get those things,
too."
</p>
<p>
"You had to start from scratch?"
</p>
<p>
"I didn't have any documents. The Younger Earl could use the Older Earl's information, but
we knew there would be legal trouble if they both worked full-time under the same name. Earl
had an uncle in the INS who could help process some immigration paperwork for me, and I
started to become a legal person. But the situation meant that the Younger Earl was often
taking on jobs for cash. It strained the relationship between them. At the beginning they
were the same, then brothers, and one day they were just roommates, tired of speaking to
each other.
</p>
<p>
One night the Older Earl was out late, and the Younger Earl asked if I wanted
to go somewhere. I'd been cooped up in my hometown, unable to see my friends or family because
they thought I was a liar, so of course I said, 'anywhere'. We both drove the night and
the next morning, to Arizona, then up to the Grand Canyon."
</p>
<p>
Sally was strangely cautious telling the story, as she had never told it to anyone before.
"We walked up to the rim of the canyon, in the cold wind that comes while you wait for the
sunset, and I whispered, 'I've never seen it before.' And he replies, smooth as ever,
'Me neither. From now on we have this moment, and the others don't.' We slept in the car
that night, uncomfortable as anything, but for the first time in years, I slept soundly."
</p>
<p>
"And did you ever see the other one of him again, the Older Earl?" I asked. "I assume you
stayed with the Younger Earl."
</p>
<p>
"That's right, we stayed together on the road for a few days. We knew we couldn't make money
that way. We just needed to know there was another person in the world who had been cast
out of their life, like we had.
</p>
<p>
When we went back, the Older Earl was staying up late, watching the evening news. He never
did that when we were together - I assume he was waiting for us. Finally he spells out a
plan, where he takes their passport and works with a charity in Nigeria for the rest of his
life, and the remaining documents would be enough for the Younger Earl to take over his life
in the States. It was a big sacrifice on his part, one which I never understood. But the
Younger Earl agreed immediately; he told me it had been a dream of his, so he knew the
Older Earl would be happy going."
</p>
<p>
"I don't suppose you can get me in contact with him? This is going to make the investigation
a lot more difficult, if I'm only talking to you and Earl here, and your duplicates don't get
involved."
</p>
<p>
"We have enough money now, especially from my last auction, that you can have all of the
funding that you need. I just want to know, where did I come from?" A pause. "No one has
been able to tell me that in all of these years. Just find out where I came from, please."
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
The only details which Sally could add from that point were minor. The main question, then,
was how to get Earl involved, to find out what he might know about the duplication. To move
forward, Sally suggested a fantastic but bizarre plan.
</p>
<p>
"I will tell him that we should see a couples counselor," she explained, "and once you've
established some rapport, you can ask him some deeper questions."
</p>
<p>
"Well I was going to ask him about the metaphysics of it, which I don't suppose would come
up in the relationship between you two."
</p>
<p>
"To the contrary, I feel like there's a lot that he's withholding from me. Maybe his
answers seem a little evasive. For example, when I asked what he was looking for, why he came
back to Baton Rouge just before the event, I can't get a... well I'm never so good at this...
but I can't get a read on whether he's telling me the truth. I don't even know enough
about the paranormal sciences to know whether his answer is a good one. I know he must be working on how this happened. And maybe he's solved it, but doesn't want
to tell me. One day I was home sick, and saw a special on parallel universes and string
theory, that sort of thing, so I asked him, well, if we came from a parallel universe."
</p>
<p>
"Is that what you think?"
</p>
<p>
"I could tell that he was considering it. And so I asked, does that mean that I'm missing
from the universe? Does that mean that we can go back? And I couldn't get a word out of him
for a day after that."
</p>
<p>
"Well, it's a disturbing thought. You lost your family when you came here, and if there's
another universe where they lost you, it makes it worse. But Earl hasn't experienced the
loss on his end, because he took over the older Earl's place, so he hadn't thought about
either loss yet."
</p>
<p>
"See, you'd do great as our counselor!" She laughed. "This is exactly why we need someone
with experience in the paranormal. But you have to have your office sharpened up a bit
so that he doesn't figure it out. Not until you build up that rapport, or whatever I said.
He says it's not polite to talk about the paranormal, not until he finds a hint that they
could relate."
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
I had two weeks to frame the office as a couples counselor's office. Where usually a lone
client sat in a wicker chair, describing their paranormal experiences, their dreams, their
delusions sometimes, I brought in a comfortable couch. A shelf of rare Indonesian idols,
their original temples smashed by monotheistic zealots (more out of fear than religious
piety), was replaced with a set of innocuous books. The office plants, even, seemed more
striking and exotic than you would find in a calming space. Lastly, I stowed away my class
photo with Dr. Chabon. In the photo you can see that he was frail and near death, but still
full of intensity, more eager than ever to solve the mysteries of the universe. It didn't
seem right to hang another picture in its place, but I did borrow a travel poster and prop
it against the wall.
</p>
<p>
The day before our first appointment, Sally wanted to come in and see whether it would
suit the project, but I urged her not to. It was important that she see the building with
new eyes.
</p>
<p>
I arrived earlier than usual on the morning before our first session. I flipped through the
first pages of an actual family counseling book. The sun streamed in through a window behind
my chair. I struggled with an onset of nerves brought on by meeting another researcher,
by deceiving him, by ignoring the elephant in the room and stealing one of the greatest
mysteries that we'd ever encountered from right under his nose! In the last ten minutes,
I remembered to sprint back down the hall and warn the receptionist to say as little as possible
to the Jacobses. "Very talkative, anything could set them off. Just point them my way."
She nodded.
</p>
<p>
At last I could hear the receptionist buzzing them in, the footsteps down the hallway, and
a hand on the door. Just act like you do this every day, I told myself.
</p>
<p>
Earl had the same youth as Sally, but held an odd intensity and alertness common to the
paranormal profession. He had worn a dress shirt and tie to the meeting, and introduced
himself and Sally formally, making his best effort to show her that he took the meeting
seriously. Sally wore dull clothes, and clasped her hands in her lap as she sat down, but
when Earl looks away, she flashes me a faint smile. She believes every part of her story.
She believes that we are on the cusp of finding something.
</p>
<p>
"Would you tell me about how you met?" I asked.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
Earl's story was markedly different from Sally's and - since I had read the police records
- deliberately misleading. He acknowledged that they met through Sally's historic tours, leaving
out the detail about the ghost stories. He jumped ahead from one event to another, not
explaining what drew them together, only that they found a common interest in the town and
Sally was feeling "trapped" there. Sally nodded and added details only occasionally. It
was the story that he always told people, I gathered.
</p>
<p>
"I think it matters how couples meet," I said, trying to pick the tone for wise but common
-sense advice, "because it sets the tone of the relationship."
</p>
<p>
Sally perked up. "Does it?"
</p>
<p>
"Well of course it does." I look to Earl for a reaction.
</p>
<p>
"For me, I think we set a tone a few weeks later. We took... a little cliche I'm sure...
we took a roadtrip to the Grand Canyon together.  We knew so little about each other before
then. And we went to this one spot off the main trail" - Earl gestured wildly with his hands,
even though there was no map or reference for his gestures - "where you couldn't see a soul
around. Where we were the only ones with this new experience, and we were facing it together."
</p>
<p>
Sally beamed.
</p>
<p>
The hour was almost over, and I hadn't gotten any deeper into the mystery part. I made some
final comments, scribbled on a notepad, and scheduled an hour appointment. "Usually we
will meet weekly, but this week I am still getting to know you both. It's helpful for me
to follow up within a few days." Both of them checked their schedules on their phones.
At this moment, even though I had yet to prove they were duplicates, a shiver ran down
my spine. Their motions and the parting handshake, though normal, took on an alien quality.
Was it fair to wonder if they were from another universe?
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
The next day I met with the nanofibers client and offered him a seat on the new couch.
</p>
<p>
He took one look at the new office decor and shouted, "what on earth..?"
</p>
<p>
I gave him a mischievous look. "Couples counseling."
</p>
<p>
He laughed and patted me on the back. "let's get out of this dollhouse."
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
The meetings with Sally and Earl went on. Earl had a story covering every aspect - his
brother had signed up for a mission trip in Africa and disappeared off the face of the map.
Sally, too, had stories concocted. She was adopted, she insisted, and her foster parents
had long since retired. "I think they're still driving around the country in a big RV."
</p>
<p>
It was a flawless story, but of course it was. There was no reason for the story to be
doubted, and even if someone found a hole in their explanation, they would never hit upon
the truth. The possibility that they were from another universe, as I now suspected, and
fully integrated into our own. Never drawing suspicion.
</p>
<p>
Four more sessions went by, without the faintest trace of Earl caving. At times their
conversation delved into the matters which a good couples counselor would understand - into
their petty household arguments, their presents for each other on Valentine's Day, their
little morning rituals. I started to think that they would have been excellent material
for an actual couples counselor!
</p>
<p>
For our sixth session, Sally and I agreed to leave one of the Indonesian idols on the
coffee table as a decoration. When Earl and Sally entered the room, Earl immediately
reached out to the idol, stopped his fingers an inch before touching the idol, and looked
up. "Is this real?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
"Another couple brought it in. The wife was a collector of some antiques, and they were
afraid it was becoming a hoarding habit. She gave me this one as a gift."
</p>
<p>
"I highly doubt that," Earl countered, as he examined the statuette. "This is an idol
of Nettle. Supposedly the recipient of the idol is more likely to side with the giver
in a dispute. In a double-blind study there were some interesting results..." Earl drew
his hand back again, never quite touching it.
</p>
<p>
I remembered, somewhat disconcertingly, when I received the idol from a very convincing
activist. My cover story... no, I didn't need to take it seriously right now. "Are you
familiar with -eh- the occult?" using the vulgar term for the supernatural. "I never knew
what it was."
</p>
<p>
"Not really, but I don't want to get into bad voodoo, you know? Don't touch it, Sally."
Sally and Earl sat down, and I moved the idol to the shelf where it belonged.
</p>
<p>
"Earl doesn't like to say so, but he's always been into that sort of thing," Sally forced
a laugh and went on: "I even did a couple of ghost tours back before I left Louisiana."
</p>
<p>
"Really? Ever catch one?"
</p>
<p>
Earl drummed his fingers on his arm of the couch. "I would like to tell you it was all
nonsense, but I was part of a troop of ghost hunters right out of school... the things
that I saw would turn your stomach and make your eyes open wider than you thought possible.
I'll have you know-" Sally grabbed his hand "-they didn't pay us to find out if these things
were real. They were real, and they paid us to deal with it, without flinching, without
screaming, no matter how strange it was. And no matter how harmless it was, they wanted it
gone. In today's world, people can't come to terms with something existing beyond
explanation. They fear it at first sight, and they still fear it after it's gone."
