# Concept

November is <a href="http://nanowrimo.org">NaNoWriMo</a>, short for National Novel Writing Month.

Participants write a 50,000 word novel by the end of the month - about 1,667 words per day!

This repo will host anything which I write on GitHub Pages. I will add some
templating so that the story can be more browseable.

# Story

I wrote a short story, about 800 words long, while I was wrapping up Code for America. I
left it alone for a while, but there were a lot of gaps and backstory which could be filled
in. I wrote a longer outline during late October, and decided that if I wrote 1,500 words
per line of the outline, I would be in the clear. I'm averaging about half of that?


# How is NaNoWriMo?

There's no time to reflect on what I'm writing, so parts of it seem really wordy or drawn
out. Remember, I am fleshing out an 800 word fragment of a story. At 6,700 words I closed
that document because I had finished with all of the parts which had been written there.
Fortunately there are a few more phases in my story outline, perhaps equal in length, but
finishing the month is going to be a challenge.

I usually write code, nonfiction, or short stories in the third person with no dialogue,
so writing something longer is draining. Also I just started a new job on the 21st and
moved into an apartment at the beginning of the month. I can't skip any days, because then
I need to write extra on the other days.

It feels draining, but here I am writing more, into GitHub.
