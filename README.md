# Concept

November is <a href="http://nanowrimo.org">NaNoWriMo</a>, short for National Novel Writing Month.

This repo will host anything which I write on GitHub Pages. I will add some
templating so that the story can be more browseable.

# Issues

If you see spelling, grammar, logic, or other issues please create a GitHub Issue.

# License

This repo is under a GPLv3+ copyleft license unless otherwise negotiated.
