      NaNoWriMo+ Short Story</h1>
<p>
The fourth inhabited planet emerged from behind the star. Gramee waited up, expecting it, and
sent dozens of saved-up messages across the void.
</p>
<p>
Jab answered. On the far end of the planet's orbit, Jab had been planning a new venture to find
alien life. "We cannot be alone in the universe. We must contact other civilizations."
</p>
<p>
It wasn't a new argument. The planets in the system had worked together to send a mission to
a few promising planetary systems in their part of the galaxy, but had never received an
intelligible response. Their probes went unanswered. It would be difficult to rally support
for a new mission.
</p>
<p>
Jab had peered into a new part of the night sky and found a new system. "Eight planets. One in
the habitable zone." The others - Jant and Pol - sent their interest from their worlds. Jab's
catalogues had dozens of similar systems, but even the most promising ones did not reply.
</p>
<p>
Gramee knew already in her heart that she would have to support Jab. They had been the first two
to restore contact since the planets had been colonized. Keeping a sane communication system on
the surface of one planet was difficult; messaging between worlds was a natural evolution of the
system, but it had to be determined before their languages became too disparate; before the
genetics of their cells diverged. While they were all one species.
</p>
<p>
The planets made a few new cycles around the stars. Jant had been talked into building a new
craft, a tiny one in his appendages, but one which could be accelerated to near light speed.
Rock from a small, hollow asteroid was used to shield their sensors and transmitters from the
radiation and micrometeorites in transit.
</p>
<p>
The launch was over and done with in a couple more planetary cycles. The probe disappeared into
nothingness, but little pings came back on each cycle.
</p>
<p>
Pol's calculation was that the next message would be more than a ping. The probe would decelerate
just above the atmosphere of a planet inside the star's habitable zone. It would then
direct messages toward any sign of life on the surface. There were few messages in the wires.
They didn't want even the faintest of replies to be missed.
</p>
<p>
Their probe rapidly dropped out of near-light-speed above the distant world. Data was collected
and streamed back. It looked down on a small, red planet. Failing to identify any settlements, the
probe decided to deliver its message to the planet's pole. Suddenly the data feed cut out.
Gramee pre-emptively sent a volley of supportive messages to Jab, but they were not returned.
</p>
<p>
Then came the explanation: "a nearby planet disabled our probe with electromagnetic waves". Jab
was excited. "They could not reach our probe, so they used a primitive hack."
</p>
<p>
They moved their attention to the other planet. It was much too close to its star, but its thick
atmosphere must have shielded them. Gramee suggested using metal to ward off the increased
radiation. Jant reluctantly patched it to the craft. Pol shot it into hyperspeed.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
The asteroid decelerated and to Earthly eyes appeared suddenly in geosynchronous orbit.
It sent a stream of rocks streaking back to its origin in deep space. In a last, futile effort
astronomers beamed radio messages and mathematical codes at the spongey blob. Another distant
meteor streaked across the sky and was absorbed by the living alien material.
It acknowledged the message, and began its drop to contact the Earth's surface.
</p>
<p>
The last cry of a planet went ignored by its distant explorers. Meteors streaked, bounced,
and rebounded between those alien planets. Their surfaces rippled with a hail of thousands of
internal and interplanetary messages. And the one called Jab insisted: "we must contact other
civilizations".
