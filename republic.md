# The Islamic Republic of 19th and Irving

It was a brilliantly clear morning when I first saw the Islamic Republic. Minutes earlier I had woken up on couch cushions laid
out by my friend in her Gramercy Park apartment. Sunlight filled the room but did not wake her. I needed to get home, though
the reason - real or imagined - I forget.

As soon as I hit the street, I used my phone to pick out directions. It was then that I noticed the small icon on the corner of
my map. I looked up from the phone to see two men waving a green and white flag out a window. Only in New York. I waved back and
forgot entirely. But as everyone knows, once you hear of a new phenomenon, it recurs and recurs until you wonder how you could
have been ignorant of it the entire time. It took two days for the second spark.

I glanced over at Jim, my editor, who had forwarded the story. He was consumed in other work, so I read. At the time, people who
knew about the Islamic Republic and its Imam were divided over whether it was a cult of personality, or a house of worship which
had gone off the rails. But most people, like me, didn't know.

We agreed that I should write a piece for the magazine.

## The Visa

A few days later, I received my visa in an official-looking, carefully bubble-wrapped envelope. Unwrapping the flat foil inside,
I found a single printed page emblazoned with the words JOURNALIST VISA, signed by the Imam. I was granted permission to interview
members on that Thursday. "Come to the northwest corner of 19th and Irving, and buzz 10A", it says, "Have your visa and passport
ready when you exit the elevator on the 10th floor".

I did.

## The Visit

The Islamic Republic is housed in a nondescript apartment building, a few blocks from the nearest subway station. The

All of the buzzers for the 10th floor were unmarked, but buzzing 10A provoked an immediate response.

"Terry, from Tech Time Magazine?"

"Yes".

"Do you have your passport and visa with you?"

"Yes".

"The elevator is straight ahead of you."

The door was buzzed, and I opened it up to see a drab, windowless lobby. Up a few steps and across the tiled floor were a few
chairs, plastic ferns, a bulletin board for residents.

When the elevator doors closed and the motor jolted to life, I couldn't help but think of the mystery that it would take me up
to a different country, and feel a twinge of anxiety.

After a quick look-over by a man in a uniform, ostensibly the customs official, the hall filled with young men some in t-shirts
and jeans, others in a more traditional Islamic robe, though one assured me that it was only because they had just finished
attending a lecture. Every door in the hall was open. The one nearest to me appeared to be a stockroom, with fresh fruit and
bulk packs of toilet paper. Stepping in further, I saw the back wall lined with canned food. I was hustled onto the next room,
a library, where boys and girls lay on their stomachs and read from book.

"Take a photo, sir?"

The tour went on.

## The Ex

"I suppose you want to know what he believes. If he believes."

I interview the imam's ex-wife while she smokes illegally, incredibly illegally, in the back kitchen of a Chinese takeout
restaurant. No one seems to notice or care - she is beyond the law, in her own country.

"I don't talk about that. Did you ever notice how when psychos are in the news, the reporters are rushing in to report on his
every word? Tell us again about the angels. Explain to the TV why you snapped. Not once is a psycho going to tell you
something that makes you think, makes you reconsider what they did. They might have different reasons today and tomorrow."
"There was a day he told me we should work together to bring Islam to China, another day he says we need to stay in America
and show this country can be saved, for years he said that they would be a utopia with no money, that they would live simply,
now I hear he prints his own currency and sells it online."

"He can be contradictory, then? You think that a quote that I publish today will be out-of-date tomorrow?"

"If you narrow it down, I am sure you can find core beliefs which were consistent the whole time. I'm not going to spell it out
for you. Getting the apartments was a blessing for him - he was able to make a community, which he's always wanted. But it also
means that he can make rules on a whim."

As I left, I got a lengthy e-mail from the Imam asking if I knew anyone who would take an interest in developing an app. He
asked if we could place an advertisement in the article.

## The Article

It was the first time that I saw my article headline printed out on a cover. They called me into
the room when the final layout was being drawn up. MAP OF A MICRONATION rolled up carefully underneath the headline story of
pop stars' forays into venture capital. I ordered copies for my parents and one of my college professors.

With the final approval from the director and the dev-ops team, the digital edition went live on a Monday night with a stack of
queued social media blips.

The next morning I woke up in my apartment to a flurry of notifications. Some thought the story was made up. Others warned that
it was far too political for a tech magazine. Another simply said, "lived there two days; the man is a loon and knows nothing
about Islam".

## The App

## The Pilgrimage

I heard that the article and app brought a burst of publicity to the program, but for the most part my interest faded as the
number of views on the article faded. There wasn't a lot new to report on a country which had been run out of someone's
apartment for ten years, where time and reason seemed frozen to one point.
