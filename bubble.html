      <br/>
      Camp NaNoWriMo Story</h1>

<p>
<em>Tribhuvan International Airport, Kathmandu, Nepal</em><br/>
It was only a few days into the crisis that Jan arrived at Delta Hangar. The massive doors opened only a small
crack and as soon as he and Mary had passed through, they closed again. No sunlight. Dead air.
</p>
<p>
Inside a C-5 plane like the one which brought them was sitting on blocks, its nose in the air, revealing its
inner cargo bays. The plastic seals were being torn off the equipment, tarps being set up over the wings.
</p>
<p>
In the buzz of activity Jan saw only one thing: a stainless steel tube with water beading down its frozen
face - the containment freezer.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
After the door closed and the plane began to de-pressurize, Mary disappeared into her compartment. Jan remembered
a bag of his things which was waiting in his own bunk. The first thing he found was an altimeter, which he would be using to 
track the pressure changes. They planned to change the atmosphere more than two thousand feet per day - any more would
be straining their work in the suits. It would be five days to reach the pressure of the hot zone.
</p>
<p>
<i>The hot zone</i>, he thought, was something of a misnomer. It was still cold this time of year in the mountains, and bitter winds
roared through valleys in the night. But something was still moving from house to house, from kitchen to stable, from traveler to tenant.
The first Jan had heard about it, he'd been on lunch break, dawdling in a bakery, waiting for a spring rain to clear up. Mary called with
a few questions about CDC bureaucracy. Minutes later, the biggest of the bureaucrats that he'd named was calling Jan back to work.
</p>
<p>
The first problem was that hemorrhagic fevers, like ebola, didn't belong here. The second was that no one had identified the source.
The virus incubates and infects people, as everyone knows, but the virus cannot persist that way. They kill a person before enough
of their cells can be given the new orders to produce viruses. They halt a person before they can travel. It cannot persist
in villages - they kill too quickly for that. Instead the virus lay dormant in some species, likely a mammal, until one of its mutant offshoots
finds its way into a human. Where it fails to take over a cell. But one day out of many, it succeeds.
</p>
<p>
The final problem, which had put Jan and Mary into the flight lab, was that the outbreak was occurring at high altitude. The first observers
had come back faint, with headaches and bloody noses. The data they had collected was bad. Either it was wrong or it was biased or it was
a particularly vicious outbreak. There wasn't enough information to know what was happening. They needed people acclimated.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, the team had collected samples. In the container, Jan knew, were a dozen vials from people known to have died, to have been sick
and lived, to have cared for the sick, and the control samples. The flight lab could not fully test these - how do you test the unknown? - but the
CDC had agreed not to extract blood from the country.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
"Move it a little more."
<br/>
"I'm trying".
<br/>
The intercom chirped and broke their concentration. "Sample test incoming. Immediate test needed."
The sample airlock was already being ground open on the other side.
<br/>
"We're running a cross-tab on some samples now.".
<br/>
"The sample is priority one." It was being carefully removed from its container now, so it could be transferred into the lab containment.
<br/>
Jan moved over to the speaker phone. "Background?"
<br/>
"Two weeks ago, a mining truck from Kim Pass crashed outside the capital. The driver and a passenger were bleeding before the crash.
We need to know right away if they were sick."
<br/>
"Mary, transfer the sample."
<br/>
There was a rush of air as the outer door closed and the inner lock opened.
<br/>
"We'll test it once we've gotten it up to code and divided it into several samples."
<br/>
The intercom gave no further instructions.
<br/>
"What's wrong, Mary?"
</p>
<p>
Mary tapped her face-shield, looked down and back up again.<br/>
"I thought I saw a bubble in the sample."
<br/>
"What do you mean?"
<br/>
"When I flip it from outside pressure to low pressure, it should stay sealed in the vial. But I think there was a bubble."
<br/>
"What are you are talking about?' Jan made sure his own shield was still on and leaned forward. The vial *looked* sealed but
could easily could have a microscopic crack.
<br/>
"If there's a bubble that means it's in our air doesn't it?" Mary stopped herself. "I don't know if I saw the bubble."
<br/>
"Better switch to lab supply? Suit up?"
<br/>
"Yes".
<br/>
"Basecom this is Jan. We are suiting up now. The sample looks fragile."
<br/>
"I don't understand. Are you at risk?"
<br/>
"I don't know. Make sure you get ahold of anyone who touched this sample on your end." A pause. "Can you do that, Basecom?"
<br/>
There was some mumbling. "Jan, I was holding the sample container before we put it into the plane. I'll call back the lead team."
<br/>
"Keep their car in containment and have the researchers stay on base."
<br/>
"I agree this is a good plan."
<br/>
" I need to get suited up now."
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
"Jan! I've been reading about this and you're going to be okay. They have ebola medications in treatment. Once they know you're okay, they're
going to ship you and Mary up into the mountains and..."
<br/>
"It's not ebola".
<br/>
"Then you ought to have something to treat it then. All those doctors in..."
<br/>
"I don't think you know what I'm telling you. It's not in your book. It's not ebola."
</p>

<blockquote>
This morning, after an agreement was reached with the government of Nepal, I gave an order for the US Air Force to drop a deep-ground explosive on the
rocky slope of Kijani. We successfully cut off the Ree Kim Valley, where a deadly virus has killed hundreds - almost three quarters of affected patients. There is no known vaccine,
cure, or long-term treatment. Medical officials in the United States and worldwide advised us that the virus was too dangerous to take any chances. We will continue
to deliver aid to the valley, with the strongest protections against spreading the disease.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
There is also a risk that the virus has spread outside the valley. We are isolating and investigating each case.  There is a family in a nearby village which is confirmed to have
the virus. There is a child recovering in a hospital in Qatar.There are two American doctors who have been exposed. These are the only confirmed cases in the entire world.
We wish them all well. You are in our prayers.
</blockquote>

<p>
Mary skin had faded, but her eyes were awake and alert. From her screen, she could see the containment stretcher coming
up the airlock tube to the airplane. She adjusted her blanket again.
<br/>
The satphone rang and began to speak. "We will pressurize FlightLab for medical extraction."
<br/>
"Understood"
<br/>
There was no one watching the lab camera for this. Mary noticed, too. She said, finally, "I've never congratulated you."
<br/>
"For what?"
<br/>
"For being immune. Brand new virus kicking around and your body doesn't give a fuck."
<br/>
It was unreal. Jan was holding his breath even though he was behind a mask.
<br/>
"I see they've come for me."
<br/>
"Yes."
<br/>
"I'm thinking about containment. I'll never leave that box as long as I live."
<br/>
Three men were wheeling it around. They were already heavily protected.
<br/>
"They will even bury me in it."
<br/>
The rush of air into the plane cabin drowned out any other noise. Mary turned back to the monitor now, knowing she had said her peace, her final words as a
free person.
