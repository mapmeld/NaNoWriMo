      Camp NaNoWriMo Story</h1>

<p>
<em>Tribhuvan International Airport, Kathmandu, Nepal</em><br/>
It was only a few days into the crisis that Jan arrived at Delta Hangar. The massive doors opened only a small
crack and as soon as he and Marie had passed through, they closed again. No sunlight. Dead air.
</p>
<p>
Inside a C-5 plane like the one which brought them was sitting on blocks, its nose in the air, revealing its
inner cargo bays. The plastic seals were being torn off the equipment, tents being set up under the wings.
</p>
<p>
In the buzz of activity Jan saw only one thing: a stainless steel tube with water beading down its frozen
face - the containment freezer.
